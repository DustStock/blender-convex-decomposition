* Blender Plugin For Convex Decomposition

This Blender addon makes [[https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd][V-HACD]] and [[https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD][CoACD]] available inside Blender.

It can also export a mesh and its collision shapes to Unreal Engine via FBX.

** Installation
Grab (or build) the binaries for [[https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd][V-HACD]] and/or [[https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD][CoACD]] from their website.

Install the [[convex_decomposition.py][convex_decomposition.py]] addon like you would any other Blender
addon and specify the path to the V-HACD and CoACD binaries in the preferences.

Now you should have a =ConvDecomp= panel in Blender's =N-menu= as shown in the
screenshots.

** Usage
Select an object and a solver, then press =Run=.

The solver may run for several minutes (especially CoACD) during which the
Blender UI will be unresponsive. Afterwards, the shapes will appear in the scene
and be parented to the original object. The addon will also place the shapes
into a dedicated =convex hulls= collection to easily (un)hide all of them at
once.

The shape names adhere to the [[https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/WorkingWithContent/Importing/FBX/StaticMeshes/#collision][FBX convention]] for Unreal and you can export the
mesh with the =Export= button. Please note that this is a convenience function
only and not meant to replace a proper Blender -> Unreal workflow.

Please refer to the official [[https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd][V-HACD]] and [[https://github.com/SarahWeiii/CoACD][CoACD]] sites for an explanation of the
parameters.
