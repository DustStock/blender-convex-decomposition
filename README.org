** Todo [4/11]:
   - [X] Rename =mouse-pointer=
   - [X] Expose solver parameters
   - [X] Rename property group
   - [X] Fix the empty export problem
   - [ ] Figure out the registration process
   - [ ] Create plugin with global [[https://b3d.interplanety.org/en/add-on-preferences-panel/][preferences]]

   - [ ] Experiment with a modal operator
     - [ ] Run subprocess asynchronously.
     - [ ] Poll output and show in a window so the user can see the progress.
     - [ ] Add abort button.
